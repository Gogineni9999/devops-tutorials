# Cost-benefit Analysis and SRE Impact

## SRE Teams Reduce Risk

- Live & breathe risk management
- Contend with 99.99% and 99.999% up-times
- Less than five minutes of allowable downtime per month.
- Core functions and best practices of SRE all revolve around managing risk.

## The Cost of Downtime

- The actual cost of downtime is unknown
  - Recent studies estimate it between $5,600-$9,000 per minute.
- 99.99% uptime allows for about 4.5 minutes of downtime a month.
  - This equates to $25,000-$40,000 in loss per month.
- 99.999% uptime allows for about 26 seconds of downtime per month.

## SRE Costs

**Redundancy** or adding more IT infrastructure in different geographies.

Provides capabilities such as:

- Taking a server offline to perform maintenance
- Implement zero-downtime deployments
- Routing traffic away from a problem server during an incident

**Opportunity Costs**

- Improving the system means not building revenue-generating features
- Slows the release of new features
- Regular operations work keeps SRE teams from engineering
