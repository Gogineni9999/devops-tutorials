# Enterprise Workflows

> **Toil** -- any task that takes a reaction and interrupts a human.

## Toil is defined as

**Overhead** -- completing a number of sub-tasks prior to running the actual task

**Manual Intervention** -- if the computer can complete the task just as well or better than a human, then the human ought to step aside and let the computer do its job.

**Repetitive Tasks** -- things that need human intervention over and over again, either on a regular schedule (like running a monthly report) or reacting to a server constantly having a disk full of log files

Any task that takes a reaction and interrupts a human.
