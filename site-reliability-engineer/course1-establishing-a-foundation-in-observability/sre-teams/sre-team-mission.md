# SRE Team Mission

The benefits of a team mission/vision include:

- Shared approach
- Strategy
- Direction to solving a problem
- Providing benefits more significant than the team itself
- Higher work satisfaction
- Less conflict

Teams are made up of people, and people have their own beliefs and values. Values guide decisions, and decisions guide behavior. A newly formed team must establish core values that are agreed upon by team members. The benefits include:

- Building trust
- Providing psychological safety
- Embracing risk
- Providing a sense of inclusion

After a team is formed and the core values are set, a survey is taken to identify the factors that a team encounters. This is typically done by using a SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for:

**Strengths** -- characteristics of the team that give it an advantage over other teams

**Weaknesses** --characteristics of the team that give it a disadvantage to others

**Opportunities** -- elements in the environment that the team could exploit to its advantage

**Threats** -- elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the team

Once this exercise has been completed, it ought to paint a picture of the team's capabilities and provide discussion topics on alignment, coordination, and workflows. From this, goals can be formed, and from those goals, the mission can be defined.
