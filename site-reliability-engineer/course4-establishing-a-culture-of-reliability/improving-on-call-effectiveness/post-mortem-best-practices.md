# Post-Mortem Best Practices

A **blameless culture** is one that focuses on accountability and root cause analysis over finger-pointing when there is an incident.

**Post-mortems** are a valuable tool in a blameless culture to help delve into the issue and find not only the root cause but also a remedy for it. You can use a post-mortem document to help guide the discussion.

A post-mortem is similar to the live state document you used while the incident was ongoing. The big difference is the **goal of the document**:

- The live state document used during the incident was meant to keep a log of the current state of the incident.
- A post-mortem is focused on the impact and the resulting action plan.

**Here is the structure of a post-mortem:**

- **Stakeholders**: Identify the stakeholders involved and the customers affected. This can be the same as those in the live state document.
- **Timeline**: Include a timeline of major events critical to understanding the incident.
- **Impact Assessment**: Detail how business goals, customers, systems, compliance, were affected.
- **Resolution**: Describe how the incident was resolved, including what actions were necessary to resolve the incident and why.
- **Action Plan**: Describe what actions are necessary to fix the root cause of the issue.

It is important to **regularly review post-mortems** for several reasons:

1. Practice the incident management process so that it becomes second nature for engineers.
2. Follow up on remediation.
3. Review this process for potential enhancements.
