# Common Toil Reduction Strategies

Now that you know how to identify and measure toil, let's look at some strategies for handling and reducing toil. Some common toil reduction strategies include

- **System refactoring**
  - Reduce unnecessary redundancy. Some common ways to do so include
  - Condense similar services onto one host.
  - Migrate physical hosts to VMs.
- **Uniformity**
  - More uniform systems are easier to manage.
  - This is especially true if you are using automation and configuration management tools; you do not have to rewrite the same scripts to work on multiple systems.
- **Capacity planning**
  - Capacity planning is also a way of reducing toil.
  - Proper capacity planning allows systems to react to a wide range of demand and resource usage scenarios without human intervention.
- **Automation**
  - Automation is key to reducing toil. The more tasks machines can perform, the more time you have to focus on reliability.
  - Automate tasks so that they can be triggered automatically whenever possible.

More strategies exist, but this is a good foundation to get you started.
