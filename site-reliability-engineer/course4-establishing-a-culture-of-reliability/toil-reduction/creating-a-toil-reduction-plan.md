# Creating a Toil Reduction Plan

The steps for creating a toil reduction plan are:

1. **Identify and measure toil**
   - Having an idea of the total amount of toil you are facing and measuring how much toil a particular task represents, you can establish a baseline for reviewing your progress later.
2. **Prioritize the tasks to reduce toil**
   - Perform cost-versus-benefit analysis to help prioritize the items.
   - Tasks that increase reliability should have greater priority.
3. **Decide on strategies for eliminating toil**
   - Each item may have several possible strategies.
   - You can also combine strategies depending on your individual circumstances.
4. **Plan for evaluating progress**
   - Evaluate your progress regularly.
   - Ensure that toil is actually decreasing.
   - Have concrete goals for each progress check.
   - Re-allocate resources as needed.
