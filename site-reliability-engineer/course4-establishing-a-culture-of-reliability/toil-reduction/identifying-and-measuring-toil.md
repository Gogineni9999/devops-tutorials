# Identifying and Measuring Toil

## Identifying Toil

In order to reduce toil, you have to be able to identify it. Toil has the following characteristics:

- **Repetitive**
  - Ask yourself, how frequently is the task done? Any task you are doing more than several times a week is probably toil.
  - How long does it take to do the task each time? Tasks that take up a good portion of time, even if they happen less frequently, are probably toil.
  - Is there a lot of effort involved in doing the task?
- **Manual**
  - Is human intervention necessary? If an event can be completely handled by a machine without the input of a human, and a person is handling it, then it is toil.
- **Automatable**
  - Any task with a clearly defined set of steps is probably automatable and is therefore toil.
  - You can prevent these types of toil from building up by automating from the start.
- **Stateless**
  - Does it accomplish something meaningful? If a task does not solve a long-term problem but rather just remedies an immediate symptom, then it probably is toil.
  - Is there a long-term and positive change in the end? If the system just returns to the status quo, the task probably is toil.

## Measuring Toil

To determine your toil load, and to track how it changes over time, you need to be able to measure toil.

There are many ways to measure toil:

- Time is a common and easy-to-use metric.
- Tracking the of number toil tasks done is another way, among others.

Your team may even have another way to track toil. What is important is that you have a way to measure toil and you apply it consistently.
