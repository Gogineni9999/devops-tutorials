# Exercise Enterprise Workflows

Here are the tasks that I think should be automated first (including the ones that are already automated):

- Database Schema Updates
- Send Emails to Users
- Cron Jobs
- Reporting process
- Password Reset Workflow

Then the following tasks are the tasks I think that can be partially automated:

- Archive Data Retrieval
- OS/System Patches
- Database Server Patching
- Configuration Management
- Log File Removal

Lastly, the rest of the tasks need human to execute:

- Data Updates
- Script library
