# Core Skills of SRE

The core skills of SRE are:

**Monitoring** -- creating dashboards to display the status of the system

**Information Gathering** -- compiling pertinent information like log files and software versions and sharing with the SRE and development teams

**The "Golden 4"** -- latency, saturation, errors, traffic

- latency - the time it takes to send a request and obtain a response
- saturation - a measure of the amount of traffic
- errors - failed requests
- traffic - how many requests are happening

**Updating The System** -- planning and coordinating system upgrades, security updates, or regular patches

**Release Coordination** -- gather everything needed for the release of the next version of the application

**Creating Infrastructure** -- providing an environment for the system to operate
