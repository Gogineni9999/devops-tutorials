# High Availability and Incident Response

## When to USE

- **High uptime** - if the business requires the highest level of uptime, then using high availability and incident response is for them
- **Complex infrastructure** - if the organization has an increasingly complex infrastructure, using strategies like infrastructure as code discussed here will apply
- **Ease of management** - if the organization desires consistency and quick deployments with little overhead, many topics discussed here will be for them
- **DR transition** - if the organization wants quick, seamless DR that is tested, high availability and incident response is for them

## When NOT to USE

- **Costs** - having multiple copies of your infrastructure and data can cost a lot of money. It's all balancing risk and cost
- **Learning curve** - some of the technologies and methods we discuss here will be new to many infrastructure teams and requires a higher level of learning
- **Software limitations** - not all software will work with high availability so each software package needs to be evaluated
