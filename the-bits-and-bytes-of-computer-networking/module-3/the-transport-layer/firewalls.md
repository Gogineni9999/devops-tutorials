# Firewalls

A device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria.

Mostly used in the Transport Layer.

**Firewalls that operate at the transportation layer will generally have a configuration that enables them to block traffic to certain ports while allowing traffic to other ports.**

Firewalls are sometimes independent network devices but it's really better to think of them as a program that can run anywhere.

For many companies and almost all home users, the functionality of a router and a firewall is performed by the same device.

Firewalls can run on individual hosts instead of being a network device.

All major modern operating systems have firewall functionality built in. That way, blocking or allowing traffic to various ports and therefore to specific services can be performed at the host level as well.
