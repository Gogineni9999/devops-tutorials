# Wireless Security

> `Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)` <br>
An encryption technology that provides a very low level of privacy.

Using WEP protects your data a little, but it should really only be seen as being as safe as sending unencrypted data over a wired connection. The WEP standard is a really weak encryption algorithm.

**The more bits in a key the longer it takes for someone to crack the encryption.**

WEP only uses 40 bits.

> `Wifi Protected Access (WPA)` <br>
WPA by default uses a 128-bit key, making it a whole lot more difficult to crack than WEP.

**Today the most commonly used encryption algorithm for wireless networks is WPA2, which uses a 256 bit key.**

> `MAC filtering` <br>
You configure your access points to only allow for connections from a specific set of MAC addresses belonging to devices you trust.
