# Subnetting

The process of taking a large network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks, or subnets.

Incorrect subnetting setups are a common problem you might run into as an IT support specialist.

With IP classes, data can only be routed to the `gateway router` (serve as entry and exit path to a certain network) responsible for the network by looking at network ID. In contrast, core internet routers only speak to other core routers. But the host ID contains so many IPs to connect to the same router.

> With subnets, you can split large network to many smaller ones. These individual subnets have their own gateway routers serving as ingress and egress point.
