# Anatomy of a Domain Name

Any given domain name has three primary parts, and they all serve specific purposes.

> `TLD (Top level domain)` <br>
> The last part of a domain name.

Administration and definition of TLDs is handled by a non profit organization, known as `ICANN or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers`. ICANN is a sister organization to the IANA, and together they helped define and control both the global IP spaces along with the global DNS system.

> `Domains` <br>
> Used to demarcate where control moves from a TLD name server to an authoritative name server.

Domains can be registered and chosen by any individual or company, but they must all end in one of the predefined TLDs.

> `The www portion` of this is known as the sub domain. Sometimes referred to as a host name if it's been assigned to only one host.

**When you combine all of these parts together, you have what's known as `Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)`.**

DNS can technically support up to `127 levels` of domain in total, for a `single fully qualified domain name`. Each individual section can only be 63 characters long, and a complete FQDN is limited to a total of 255 characters.
