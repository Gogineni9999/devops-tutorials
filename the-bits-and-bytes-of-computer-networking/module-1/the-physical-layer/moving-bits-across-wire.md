# Moving Bits Across the Wire

Bits are sent across network cables through a process called `modulation`.

### **Modulation**

A way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable.

More specifically known as line coding in computer networks. It allows devices on either end of the link to understand that an electrical charge in a certain state is 0 and another state is 1.
