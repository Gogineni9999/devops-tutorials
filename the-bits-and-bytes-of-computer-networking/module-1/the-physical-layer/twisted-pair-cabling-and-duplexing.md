# Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing

## <u>I. Twisted pair cable</u>

The most common type of cabling used for connecting computing devices.

It features pairs of copper wires that are twisted together.

These pairs act as a single conduit for information and their twisted nature helps protect against electromagnetic interference and cross-talk from neighboring pairs.

The number of pairs being used depends on the transmission technology being used.

In all modern form of networking, these cables allow for `duplex communication`.

## <u>II. Duplex communication</u>

The concept that information can flow in both directions across the cable.

> `Simplex communication` <br>
> This process is unidirectional.

**Method**:

- Reserving 1 or 2 pairs for communicating in 1 direction.
- Use the other pairs for communicating in the other direction.

> `Full-duplex` <br>
> Devices on either side of a network link can communicate with each other at the exact same time.

> `Half-duplex` <br>
> Communication is possible in each direction, only 1 device can communicate at a time.
