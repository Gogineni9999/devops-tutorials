# Everything as a Service

> `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)` <br>
You shouldn't have to worry about building your own network or your own servers. <br>
You just pay someone else to provide you with that service.

Recently, we've seen the definition of the cloud expand well beyond infrastructure as a service. The most common of these are `platform as a service or PaaS`, and `software as a service or SaaS`.

> `Platform as a Service (PaaS)` <br>
A subset of cloud computing where a platform is provided for customers to run their services.

> `Software as a Service (SaaS)` <br>
A way of licensing the use of software to others while keeping that software centrally hosted and managed.
