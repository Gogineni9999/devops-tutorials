At the heart of Cloud computing is a technology known as hardware virtualization. Hardware virtualization is a core concept of how Cloud computing technologies work.

A single physical machine, called a host, could run many individual virtual instances, called guests.

A piece of software that runs and manages virtual machines, while also offering these guests a virtual operating platform that's indistinguishable from actual hardware.
